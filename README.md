# StarWarsApi
Project that gets data from API and puts that on the site made with JavaScript and Bootstrap.<br>
Project was made for learning purposes, and to show my abilities of working with public API.<br>
I used JavaScript, and Bootstrap for layout and RWD.<br>
Website has menu in which you can choose if you want to get information about characters, or planets from Star Wars movies.<br>
With JavaScript it handles events like loading data, or get new one from next page.<br>
Site was made with https://swapi.dev <br>
